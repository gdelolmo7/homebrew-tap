  # Never removed, because they belong to the user: ~/Airlock (the shelf and
  # the agent workspace) and ~/.airlock (approval rules, and the hook that
  # Claude Code and Codex call, which fails open once the app is gone).
  # The Application Support glob skips dotfiles, which keeps the hidden trial
  # record, so a zap and reinstall does not restart the free trial.
